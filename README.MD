### **Pull Request Title:**

`feat(ci+tests): Add basic test coverage and GitHub Actions workflow for Testnet Oro`

---

### **Description**

This PR introduces the following improvements to the `testnets` repository in support of the ongoing Oro Testnet:

*  Adds initial **unit tests** for endpoint validation, chain configuration, and Bech32 address formats.
*  Integrates a **GitHub Actions CI workflow** to run tests and lint scripts on each pull request.
*  Updates the README with instructions for running tests and contributing to test coverage.
*  Includes a lightweight test simulation script for validating RPC endpoints and error handling.

---

### **Motivation**

This contribution aligns with the KiiChain roadmap and call for infrastructure-focused improvements. Testing and CI help ensure reliability of the testnet scripts and provide a foundation for future contributions in areas like gas abstraction and RWA modules.
